LANMonkey was designed under the K.I.S.S. princepal. I.E.: Keep It Simple Stupid!

Why LANMonkey?
I like monkeys and I like LANs.

What is the real purpose of LANMonkey, are you going to sell it later?
This is for my own amusment.

Why did you invite another person to work on the project?
I can't write CSS/Javascript menu's worth a shit. Ronnie Leday is a good friend of mine that I have know for many years.

Are you a script kiddy?
Yes.

If I asked you to add a feature to this would you do it?
Maybe, depends on how much time it would take and if it is a DOS based command. 

How can I contact you?
