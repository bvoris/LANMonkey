		<FONT COLOR="BLUE"><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipconfig" target="_blank">Ipconfig</A></FONT> is a command line tool used to control network connections.
		In Windows, ipconfig is a wrapper for the command line utility to print the current connection details and to control the DHCP Client service. Similar GUI tools named winipcfg & wntipcfg also exist. The former predates ipconfig.

		<BR />
		<FONT COLOR="BLUE"><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nslookup" target="_blank">Nslookup</A></FONT> command can be used in Windows and Unix to find the IP addresses of a particular computer, using DNS lookup. The name means "name server lookup". The most common version of the program is included as part of the BIND package. A more modern alternative to nslookup is the dig program, also shipping with BIND.
		<BR />
		<BR />
		<FONT COLOR="BLUE">Net</FONT> command is used to update, fix, or view the network or network settings. Listed in the Syntax we have listed each of net commands.

		<FONT COLOR="BLUE"><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pathping" target="_blank">Pathping</A></FONT> is a network utility supplied in Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows XP. It combines the functionality of Ping with that of Traceroute (in Windows: tracert), by providing details of the path between two hosts and Ping-like statistics for each node in the path based on samples taken over a time period, depending on how many nodes are between the start and end host. The advantages of pathping over ping and traceroute are that each node is pinged as the result of a single command, and that the behaviour of nodes is studied over an extended time period, rather than the Ping's default sample of four messages or Traceroute's default single route trace. The disadvantage is that it often takes more than five minutes to produce a result.

		<FONT COLOR="BLUE"><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ping" target="_blank">Ping</A></FONT> is a computer network tool used to test whether a particular host is reachable across an IP network. Ping works by sending ICMP “echo request” packets ("Ping?") to the target host and listening for ICMP “echo response” replies (sometimes dubbed "Pong!" as an analog from the Ping Pong table tennis sport.) Using interval timing and response rate, ping estimates the round-trip time (generally in milliseconds although the unit is often omitted) and packet loss (if any) rate between hosts.

		<BR />
		<FONT COLOR="BLUE">Route</FONT> command is used to manually configure the routes in the routing table. 
		<BR />
		<BR />
		<FONT COLOR="BLUE"><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tracert" target="_blank">Traceroute</A></FONT> is a computer network tool used to determine the route taken by packets across an IP network. An IPv6 variant, traceroute6, is also widely available.
		<BR />
		<BR />
		<FONT COLOR="BLUE"><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/netsh" target="_blank">Netsh</A></FONT> or network shell, is a utility provided with Microsoft's Windows XP. It allows local or remote configuration of network settings.
		A common use of netsh is to reset the TCP/IP stack to default, known-good parameters, a task that in Windows 98 required reinstallation of the TCP/IP adapter. In this mode you must provide a log file, which will be filled with what values netsh affected. An example usage:

		<FONT COLOR="BLUE">Netstat</FONT> Display Microsoft Windows Netstat or protocol statistics and current TCP/IP network connections.
